# FirstTest

My first testing repository on GitHub.
Other additions have been made in this README folder
also, i can notice the color on the sidelines begin to change.
i also just noticed i can commit directly from vscode, now isn't that cool.
Also, i am adding this last line in the README file for no reason

keep it up bro [hefeholuwa](github.com/hefeholuwa)
